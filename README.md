## Do it Yourself Version
1. Open **Shortcuts** App and make sure you are on **My Shortcuts** tab (active tab marked in blue color)
2. Tab **All Shortcuts** and create new Shortcuts by tapping the **plus** sign in the top right of the screen next to Select.
3. You can add an icon and add a name to it as you want.
4. Tap **Add Action** and search for **Ask for Input**. Tap it to add to the action.
5. Change **Input Type** to **Number** and add prompt and type **Enter Phone Number** or any similar sentence you want. And tap **Done**.
6. Add more action by tapping the search bar near the bottom of the screen and search for **Text**. Tap it to add to the action.
7. Type **https://wa.me/** followed by select variable **Provided Input** without space. And tap **Done**.
8. Repeat step 6 but now search for **Open URLs**. Tap it to add to the action.
9. Now you successfully create the shortcut by yourself.
## How to Use
1. Run the shortcut by tapping on it. Whether you put it in the Shortcuts library, home screen, or in the widget, it should work the same.
2. In the first run you may get a privacy prompt asking your permission for Shortcuts to open “wa.me”. Just press **Allow**.
3. Input the phone number you want to chat with. The number must be **full phone number in international format**. Without any plus sign, zeroes, brackets, dashes, or spaces. This is the correct example of full phone number international format: **62811235712** and this is the wrong one ~~+628131415913~~ or ~~08131415913~~.
4. When the number is registered with WhatsApp you should be redirected to the WhatsApp chat window and there you can start chatting. When the number is not registered with WhatsApp, you will get a prompt that “**The number XXXXXXXXXXXX isn’t on WhatsApp.**”.

That it’s. Now you can chat with anyone in WhatsApp quickly without first adding their phone number to your contact.
